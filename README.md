This project was made under 36 hours by me for the college hackathon
<br>
THis project named shoplocal is aimed at providing goods to the people from the nearby sellers thereby reducing carbon emissions a lot
<br>
Also , it aims in waste managment too..
<br>
We have incorporated a feature of learning resource centre too in the seller side app(code soon on github) so that new or not so technologically advanced msme's can learn from it;
